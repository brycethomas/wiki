* [Thriving in a crowded and changing world: C++ 2006â€”2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386320):
  a medium-length (168 pages) retrospective on the evolution of C++ by Bjarne
  Stroustrup.  Title nominally says 2006-2020, but there's also good historical
  insights going all the way back to 1979.  Discusses the C++ community and how
  changes make their way into the ISO standard.
