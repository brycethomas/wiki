* [(2020) Thriving in a crowded and changing world: C++ 2006â€“2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386320):
  a medium-length (168 pages) retrospective on the evolution of C++ by Bjarne
  Stroustrup (creator of C++).  Title nominally says 2006-2020, but there's also
  good historical insights going all the way back to 1979.  Discusses the C++
  community and how changes make their way into the ISO standard.
* [(2020) Javascript: the first 20 years](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386327): a
  medium-length (189 pages) retrospective on the evolution of Javascript by
  Allen Wifs-Brock (Microsoft at the time) and Brendan Eich (creator of
  Javascript).  Covers history of how the initial language was written in 10
  days, and how it's evolved through ECMA over time.

  CACM article describing Google's TPU hardware architecture and supporting
  components such as compiler and bf16 float format.  Benchmarks against
  GPU-based solutions.
* [(2020) Domain-Specific Hardware Accelerators](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/7/245701-domain-specific-hardware-accelerators/fulltext):
  CACM article describing non-CPU hardware for performing fast and efficiency
  computation specific to a particular domain.  Highlights memory as a critical
  bottleneck for energy efficiency, performance, and chip area.  Claims that
  most programmers think about computational cost under the PRAM model:
  arithmetic functions and accesses to anywhere in a large global memory are all
  counted as unit-cost operations.  Points out that this model is highly
  unrealistic on modern hardware, especially GPUs.
